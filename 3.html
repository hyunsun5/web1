    <p>Being a scripting language, JavaScript cannot run on its own. In fact, the browser is responsible for running JavaScript code. When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it is up to the browser to execute it. The main advantage of JavaScript is that all modern web browsers support JavaScript. So, you do not have to worry about whether your site visitor uses Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox or any other browser. JavaScript will be supported. Also, JavaScript runs on any operating system including Windows, Linux or Mac. Thus, JavaScript overcomes the main disadvantages of VBScript (Now deprecated) which is limited to just IE and Windows.</p>
